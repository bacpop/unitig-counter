# unitig-counter
Uses a coloured de Bruijn graph (implemented in [GATB](https://github.com/GATB/gatb-core)) to count unitigs in bacterial populations.

## Details
This is a slightly modified version of the unitig and graph steps in [DBGWAS](https://gitlab.com/leoisl/dbgwas/) software, repurposed for input into [pyseer](https://pyseer.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
